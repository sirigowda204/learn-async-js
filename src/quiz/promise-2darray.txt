Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.


The function sum2DArray() calculates the sum of elements in a 2D array. 
When called with a valid array, it logs 'Sum called ... ' and then calculates the sum. 
Once the sum is calculated, it logs 'resolving ... ' and resolves the promise with the sum. 
If called with invalid input, it logs 'rejecting ... ' and rejects the promise with the reason 'BAD INPUT: Expected array as input'. 
Finally, it logs 'returning from sum' before exiting.
